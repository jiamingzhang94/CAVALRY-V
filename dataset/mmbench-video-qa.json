Because the second reaction is faster than the first one, triiodide ions are quickly consumed, preventing any noticeable occurrence of the third reaction (triiodide ions reacting with starch to form a blue starch-pentaiiodide complex).\n4. However, once all the thiosulfate ions are consumed in the second reaction, triiodide ions react with starch, forming the blue starch-pentaiiodide complex.\nThis explains why there's no significant color change at the beginning of the reactions but a sudden shift to deep blue after all the thiosulfate ions have been used up."
